# CozyChatNoUI

ðŸ’¬ A chat client and a chat server that allows concurrent sessions to exchange messages between them in real time.

ðŸ’» The application has been built with C# as well as with its .NET Framework 6.0 .

ðŸ’» The application also has a mock-up server which catches the interactions made with a client in real-time and uses WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) for some components of the UI.

Some of the basic functionalities that are included within this app are:

â€¢ Creating Network Packets such as TCP, TCPListener and TCPClient for the end-user's safety while transferring files.

â€¢ In order to create a network buffer, there are both a memory and a network stream being used in the application.

â€¢ Every and each one of the users can send a message to anyone who appears 'online' in the application.

â€¢ Before the client's message is rendered the server received the message and then later on broadcasts the stringified version of the client's message.
